# bite-log

## About
Do you remember that amazingly, unbelievably delicious dish you ordered at that one restaurant that one time? Exactly! Therefore, we are introducing the next big thing in nosh culture: Bite.log. We are wanting to create a webapp that will help foodies keep track of their food encounters. Eventually, it will incorporate social connections with friends and gaining achievement levels, but at its core is the idea of remembering that unforgettable dish (and what to never order again!), and expanding into new horizons of grubbing adventures.

It is a webapp that is just about the people and their food. No calorie counter or diet measures, and no judgement. Just happy taste buds and bellies, and maybe a new go-to!

## Instructions

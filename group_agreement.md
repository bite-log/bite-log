# Group Agreement

Our Team's Areas for Growth:

- Stay on track with team discussions - should not always be 100% personal conversations
- Understand personal work styles and preferences; communicate accordingly
- Understand each others' strengths and be able to have ownership over parts of project
- Learn to be vulnerable and to ask for help when needed

Our Team's Strengths:

- Commending others for their efforts and strengths
- Not being afraid to have confrontations when there is conflict - avoid passive aggressiveness
- Can't always control what happens, but you can choose how to respond - we're all on the same team
- Take risks! We should always try to push ourselves a bit.

Communication Plan:

- Slack Group
    - Check in once by day before 5:30pm; discuss if we decide to meet somewhere else or if we can't make it
    - Answer any outstanding questions within 24 hours
    
- Google Doc - Place to input ideas
- GitHub Projects - Our to-do list / kanban board

Conflict Resolution Plan:

- No diva rule. 
- No passive aggressive behavior. 
- Discussion is allowed for 20 mins, but if no resolution there will be a majority-rules vote.

Other agreements:

- Work/life balance > everything
- If super stuck on something, VOICE it! Don't spend more than half a day trying to figure something out.
- Will divvy up work based on what we feel comfortable with, while still challenging each of us in some way.
- TAKE BREAKS!

Git Process:

- At least one person should review each PR before merging.
- Will try separate tasks as much as posisble to avoid potential conflicts.
- If there are any conflicts, communicate with one another to ensure that the latest and greatest is being incorporated.
- Anytime you stop coding, A-C-P
- Always pull to local before you start coding
